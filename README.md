I'm a ML Engineer currently pursuing my Master's degree at TUHH (Technical University of Hamburg). I’m passionate about building data-driven solutions for real-world problems.

- 🔭 I’m currently exploring TinyML and IoT applications for edge computing.
- 🌱 I’m focused on learning how to build efficient pipelines for large language models (LLMs) and applying them to real-world tasks.
- ⚡ I love math, programming, data science and gardening.
